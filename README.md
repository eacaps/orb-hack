# orb vue hack
This is a sample project to demonstrate how to run @memgraph/orb@0.4.1 in vue. The basic approach was to copy the [default-view.ts] file from the orb library as `OrbView.ts` and make modifications to allow consumers to swap out the `_simulator` field.

## Project setup

```
# npm
npm ci
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
# npm
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
# npm
npm run build
```
